# Assembly Language examples for Raspberry PI

to run examples:
- copy them to your PI (you may use sync.sh tool)
- create the ARM_ENV (empty) file inside project root directory (same location as make-all.sh, should be the same as this file)
- to compile single example: cd "project name" && make
- to compile all: ./make-all.sh
